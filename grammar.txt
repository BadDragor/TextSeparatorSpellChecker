[allcase]the school
[explain]school  [] Only a limited number of nouns can go directly after at without an article. at school, at church, at play, at work, at lunch, ..., but not at hotel, at restaurant, at bank, for example. The choice between "at school/church" and "at the school/church" depends on why you are there. If you are "at school," it means you are there as a student or a teacher. If you are "at church," you are probably there for religious services. If you are at one of these places for reasons unrelated to their normal function -- for instance, if you are delivering a package or repairing the roof -- you would say "at the school" or "at the church."
